# Hello World GitHub Tutorial

## Introduction

GitHub is a powerful code hosting platform that facilitates version control and collaboration. It allows individuals and teams to work on projects collaboratively from any location. This tutorial is designed to teach you essential GitHub concepts such as repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. By following this guide, you will create your own Hello World repository and learn about GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular method for creating and reviewing code changes.

## Getting Started

To complete this tutorial, you will need:
- A GitHub account
- Internet access

You don't need to have prior coding knowledge, command line experience, or Git installation. If you encounter unfamiliar terms, you can refer to the glossary for explanations.

## Steps

### 1. Creating a Repository

A repository is a place to organize a project, containing various files, folders, and resources. Follow these steps to create your Hello World repository:
- Click on the drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of any GitHub page.
- Select "New repository."
- In the "Repository name" box, type `hello-world`.
- Provide a short description.
- Choose whether your repository will be Public or Private.
- Select "Add a README file."
- Click "Create repository."

### 2. Creating a Branch

Branching allows you to work on different versions of a repository simultaneously. By default, a repository has a main branch, but you can create additional branches for different features or edits. Here's how you can create a new branch:
- Click on the "Code" tab of your `hello-world` repository.
- Above the file list, click the dropdown menu displaying "main."
- Type a branch name, e.g., `readme-edits`.
- Click "Create branch: readme-edits from main."

### 3. Making and Committing Changes

You can make changes to files in your repository and save them as commits. Each commit has a message explaining the change. Here's how you can do it:
- Under the `readme-edits` branch, click the `README.md` file.
- Click the pencil icon to edit the file.
- Write about yourself using Markdown elements.
- Click "Commit changes" and provide a commit message.
  
### 4. Opening a Pull Request

Pull requests are proposals for changes. They show differences between your branch and the original. You can open a pull request for discussion even before the code is completed. Here's how you can do it:
- Click the "Pull requests" tab of your `hello-world` repository.
- Click "New pull request."
- Select the `readme-edits` branch to compare with `main`.
- Review the changes and click "Create pull request."
- Provide a title and description for your pull request.
- Click "Create pull request."

### 5. Merging Your Pull Request

In the final step, you will merge your changes into the `main` branch. Here's how:
- At the bottom of the pull request, click "Merge pull request."
- Click "Confirm merge."
- Click "Delete branch" to remove the `readme-edits` branch.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the Hello World GitHub tutorial. You have learned how to create a repository, manage branches, make commits, open pull requests, and merge changes. Your contributions are now reflected in your GitHub profile.

Feel free to explore more GitHub features and continue your coding journey!
